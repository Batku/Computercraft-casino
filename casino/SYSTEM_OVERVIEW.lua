CARD MECHANISM DETAILS
========================

Player Card System:
1. Player requests card at cashier
2. Memory Card is dispensed (redstone RIGHT)
3. Player right-clicks Inventory Manager with card to insert it
4. Game detects card via inventoryManager.getOwner()
5. When player quits, redstone BACK activates for 0.5s
6. This unlocks the hopper which drops the card back to player

Suggested Hopper Setup:
- Inventory Manager above hopper
- Hopper locked by redstone torch or similar
- When BACK activates, torch turns off, hopper unlocks briefly
- Card drops through to player collection area

========================

========================

Request Types:
- "get_balance"      {username: string} â†’ {balance: number}

- "add_balance"      {username: string, amount: number} â†’ {balance: number}
- "subtract_balance" {username: string, amount: number} â†’ {balance: number}
- "create_account"   {username: string} â†’ {balance: number}
